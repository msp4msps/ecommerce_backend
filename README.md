## Project Description

The following project was created as an ecommerce backend using MYSQL, Sequalize, and NodeJs

## User Story

AS A manager at an internet retail company, I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

## Technologies

```
MySQL, Sequalize, Nodejs
```

## Installation

Fork the repo and open locally

## Usage

Once the repo is forked locally, you can add a .env file with your MySQL secrets in order to connect to your DB. First create the ecommerce DB using the DB schema folder. Next, run npm run seed to seed the DB with fake information. You can then set up routes in POSTMAN/insomnia to make calls to the DB. I provide a tutorial of these steps in the screencast links above
